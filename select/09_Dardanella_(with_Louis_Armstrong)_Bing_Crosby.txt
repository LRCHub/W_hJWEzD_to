Down beside the Dardanella Bay
Where oriental breezes play
There lives a lonesome maid Armenian
By the Dardanelles with gleaming eyes
She looks across the seas and sighs
And weaves her love spell so sirenian
Soon I return to Turkestan
I will ask for her heart and hand
Oh sweet Dardanella
I love your harem eyes
I'm a lucky fellow
To capture such a prize
Oh Allah knows my love for you
And he tells you to be true
Dardanella oh, hear my sigh
Oh, sweet Dardanella
Prepare the wedding wine
There'll be one girl in my harem when you're mine
We'll build a tent just like the children of the Orient
Oh sweet Dardanella, my star of love divine
