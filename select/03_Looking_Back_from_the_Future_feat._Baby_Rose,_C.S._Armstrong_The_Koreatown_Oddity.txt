Working down my own nights
It's time to find my peace of mind
Maybe if I hold my head back
Breathe, I see through my own eyes
Fading in the black my whole life

Yeah, uh, looking back to understand where I'm at
Moving forward through the corridor of becoming detached
Even in an avalanche of some fabricated trash
The undisputed truth always get the last laugh
That's why you see spirits that resemble shattered glass
That's why the future of the world cannot be left in fragile hands
That's why when you gifted, you don't even need to brag
Or act like you better than anybody on God's green land
To be specific, name one motherfucker that didn't start as an infant
I'll wait, no I won't
Ain't no human being existed that ever skipped it
So next time they wanna pick up their shit and sniff it
I hope they won't be surprised that it don't smell terrific
Teriffic, man, my nose!
Change of the guard, the position is shifted (yeah)
And each time it does I'm in one, I can lift it

They telling us what they talking about
This hard as a motherfucker
Make a nigga wanna sing something
I know, I know
Make a nigga wanna
Tell us what they talk about
This hard as a motherfucker
Make a nigga wanna sing something
I know, no, no, no

Koreatown Oddity
In the city where plenty of peoples' dreams got squashed
I was way ahead of my time
Koreatown Oddity
Haters know we making more shit than they could judge
From the Golden State, there is no debate
In the city where plenty of peoples' dreams got squashed
I was way ahead of my time
King of tapes, even if you don't think that's the case
Koreatown Oddity [?]

Trapped in a room full of alligators and
Snakes and spiders, a giant space squid and...
Okay, okay. I hear what you say
