Ay
Ok what's the deal then
Let's go take a field trip
God you taste so sweet
I'm so lucky just to feel this
Roll another spliff up
Got you if you trip up
Only thing that I've been searching for
Is some real love
It's so tough to find
Sometimes I just wanna give up

Don't you ever be a quitter
Look into her eyes
And my tongue just wanna twist up
I can't find the words
Let's just skip to playing twister
Stay for the sunrise
Keep my up all night
Man her love so fucking potent
Like I took a couple doses
Now I'm walking on the moon
Neil Armstrong with the shit
I don't wanna come down soon
No oh
Ay ay
Like I took a couple doses
Now I'm walking on the moon
Neil Armstrong with the shit
And I don't wanna come down soon
Yea she really gotta grip
I don't want nothing to do
Ahh

Something bout her that I gotta have
Gotta grip on me
Something bout her that I gotta have
Gotta grip on me
Something bout her that I gotta have
Nothing ever felt this way
Nothing, I'm confessing

Coming straight from the heart
I, I hope you know
Coming straight from the heart
I, I hope you know
Coming straight from the heart
I, I hope you know
Coming straight from the heart
I, I hope you know
Coming straight from the
