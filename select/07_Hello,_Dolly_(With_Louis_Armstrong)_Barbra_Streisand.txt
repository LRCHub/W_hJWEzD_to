Hello, Rudy
Well, hello Harry
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You are looking swell, Manny
I can tell Danny
You're still glowin', you're still growin'
You're still goin' strong

I feel the room swaying
For the band's playing
One of my old fav'rite songs from way back when
So bridge that gap, fellas
Find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Well hello
(Look who's here) Dolly
This is Louis (hello Louis) Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong (I am so glad to be back)
You're looking swell (thank you Louis) Dolly
I can tell (Does it show) Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still growin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
And the band playin'
One of our fav'rite songs from 'way back when, so
(I remember it so, it was my favorite)

Show some snap fellas
Find her an empty lap, yeah
Dolly'll never go away again

Well, well hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

We can tell, Dolly (wow)
You're still glowin', you're still growin'

See the lights twinkle (I see them twinkle)
And you still get glances from us handsome men, so...
